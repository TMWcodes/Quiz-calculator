# Game type

A chapter-based moral exploration, where each chapter focuses on a distinct area of life (e.g., medicine, AI, war) with progressively harder or more personal dilemmas.

### Concept Refinement:

Themes: thematic areas (Trolley, Medicine, AI, etc.) as "chapters" or "levels" in the quiz.
Escalation: The stakes keep getting higher for immersion and keeping players invested in the outcome.
Moral Categories: Players’ responses will place them into categories which can be enriched by the diversity of scenarios.
